      HTML is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning
      and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are
      generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation
      (<i>CSS</i>) or functionality/behavior (<a href="">JavaScript</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either
      within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental
      aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the <a href="">Internet</a> and
      linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active
      participant in the World Wide Web.
